# DB Designer

DB Designer is a web application that allows users to brainstorm and visualize their database designs in an intuitive and user-friendly way. The application provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating and connecting tables, as well as tools for adding and editing columns, keys, and other database objects.

With DB Designer, users can easily export their designs to SQL files or images with just one click. This makes it easy to share and collaborate on database designs with others, or to quickly convert a design into a working database.
